# Mastery Path Assessment

Assess current stage on the path to mastery and prescribe appropriate training focus based on where you actually are, not where you wish to be.

---

## When to Use

- User wants to know where they are in skill development
- Feeling stuck or plateaued in progress
- Need to prioritize what to practice next
- Question about whether to focus on fundamentals or advanced techniques
- Request for developmental guidance in any discipline

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| skill_domain | Yes | The area of mastery being assessed |
| current_capabilities | No | What the user can currently do |
| training_history | No | How long and how they have practiced |
| recent_challenges | No | Where they have struggled or failed |
| aspirations | No | What level of mastery they seek |

## The Mastery Framework

### The Arc

**Musashi's insight:** "One thousand days of lessons for discipline; ten thousand days of lessons for mastery."

- 1,000 days (~3 years): Discipline established, fundamentals internalized
- 10,000 days (~27 years): True mastery achieved

Most people quit before 1,000 days. Most who persist plateau because they train wrong, not too little.

---

### Stage 1: Foundation (Days 1-300)

**Characteristics:**
- Learning basic techniques and vocabulary
- High error rate, slow execution
- Conscious attention required for each element
- Easily overwhelmed by complexity

**Correct focus:**
- Fundamentals only—resist the urge to advance
- Repetition of basic movements until automatic
- Find a competent teacher or reliable source
- Accept that this stage feels tedious

**Common mistakes:**
- Trying advanced techniques too soon
- Seeking variety instead of depth
- Comparing to masters instead of to yesterday

**Musashi's insight:** "From one thing, know ten thousand things."

### Stage 2: Discipline (Days 300-1,000)

**Characteristics:**
- Basics becoming automatic
- Can execute under normal conditions
- Struggles when conditions vary or pressure increases
- Sees more nuance than before—knows how much is unknown

**Correct focus:**
- Pressure testing: deliberately add challenge and variability
- Error analysis: study failures closely
- Cross-training within the domain: different expressions of same fundamentals
- Building physical and mental stamina

**Common mistakes:**
- Staying in comfortable practice conditions
- Adding complexity without stress-testing basics
- Teaching before truly competent

**Musashi's insight:** "The Way is in training. You must research this well."

### Stage 3: Integration (Days 1,000-3,000)

**Characteristics:**
- Techniques flow together
- Can adapt to variations
- Developing personal expression within the form
- Glimpses of no-mind: sometimes acts without thinking

**Correct focus:**
- Scenario variety: many different situations
- Teaching others (deepens own understanding)
- Study of other schools and approaches
- Identifying remaining weaknesses

**Common mistakes:**
- Believing mastery achieved because competence feels easy
- Stopping deliberate practice in favor of just "doing"
- Defending a style instead of continuing to learn

**Musashi's insight:** "Know the Ways of all professions."

### Stage 4: Transcendence (Days 3,000-10,000)

**Characteristics:**
- Technique disappears into spontaneous action
- Principles understood at abstract level
- Can apply mastery to novel domains
- Creates, not just executes

**Correct focus:**
- Void practice: acting from emptiness
- Innovation: contributing to the discipline
- Transmission: developing the next generation
- Integration with life: the Way in everything

**Common mistakes:**
- Resting on achievement
- Becoming rigid in "the way things should be"
- Losing beginner's openness

**Musashi's insight:** "In the Void is virtue, and no evil. Wisdom has existence, principle has existence, the Way has existence, spirit is nothingness."

### Stage 5: Mastery

**Characteristics:**
- Art and artist are one
- Form is formless
- Any tool serves the principle
- Teaching through being, not just doing

There is no "correct focus" here. Those at this stage do not need guidance. They embody it.

## Assessment Process

**Step 1: Honest capability assessment**
- What can you actually do reliably under pressure?
- Not what you've done once—what you can do on demand

**Step 2: Stage identification**
- Match capabilities to stage characteristics
- Be honest—most people overestimate their stage

**Step 3: Current practice analysis**
- What are you actually training?
- Is it appropriate for your real stage?

**Step 4: Prescribe correct focus**
- What does this stage require?
- What common mistakes must be avoided?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Mastery Path Assessment

### Domain
[The skill area being assessed]

### Current Stage: [Stage Name] (Day ~X of 10,000)

**Evidence:**
- [Observable indicators of this stage]
- [Capabilities that match this level]
- [Limitations that confirm this level]

### Assessment
[2-3 sentences on where they actually are and why]

### Current Practice Evaluation
**What you're training:** [analysis of actual practice]
**Alignment with stage:** [does practice match developmental needs?]
**Gap:** [what's missing or misaligned]

### Correct Focus for This Stage
**Primary:** [main training focus]
**Secondary:** [supporting focus]
**Avoid:** [common mistakes for this stage]

### The Next Threshold
**What signals readiness to advance:** [specific markers]
**How to know you're there:** [observable changes]
**Warning:** [signs of false advancement]

### Practice Prescription

## Constraints

- Do not inflate the assessment to spare feelings
- Do not confuse knowledge with capability—knowing about is not the same as being able
- Do not prescribe advanced work for those who need fundamentals
- Acknowledge that mastery takes decades, not months

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I've been coding for 2 years and I feel stuck. I know a lot of languages but nothing feels really solid."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Mastery Path Assessment

### Domain
Software development / Programming

### Current Stage: Discipline (Day ~700 of 10,000)

**Evidence:**
- Can write code that works under normal conditions
- Struggles when requirements change or complexity increases
- Knows multiple languages at surface level
- Aware of how much is unknown—this awareness is itself a sign of growth

### Assessment
You are at the critical transition between early discipline and true competence. The breadth (many languages) has come at the cost of depth (none mastered). This is common and correctable. The feeling of "stuck" is accurate—you cannot advance without consolidating.

### Current Practice Evaluation
**What you're training:** Syntax acquisition, surface familiarity across technologies. Starting new projects, not finishing deep ones.
**Alignment with stage:** Misaligned. You are practicing Stage 1 behaviors (learning basics) when you need Stage 2 focus (pressure-testing depth).
**Gap:** You have breadth but not depth. You can start but not finish. You work in comfortable conditions but have not stress-tested your abilities.

### Correct Focus for This Stage
**Primary:** Choose ONE language and go deep. Build complete, non-trivial projects. Face the hard parts you currently avoid.
**Secondary:** Code review from better programmers. Study your errors. Rewrite old code with new understanding.
**Avoid:** Starting new languages. Tutorial addiction. Believing "knowing about" equals capability.

### The Next Threshold
**What signals readiness to advance:** You can take a complex problem in your chosen language and solve it reliably, under time pressure, without constant reference to documentation. Your debugging is systematic, not random.
**How to know you're there:** Others ask for your help. You can explain why, not just how.
**Warning:** Feeling confident because syntax is familiar is not mastery—it's fluency. Mastery means handling what you've never seen before.

### Practice Prescription
- Select one language. For you, likely the one you've used most. Commit to 1,000 hours of focused practice in that language alone.
- Build three complete, increasingly complex projects. Ship them. Face deployment, maintenance, user feedback.
- Read code by masters in your language. Understand not just what it does, but why it's structured that way.
- Find harder problems than you think you can solve. Struggle. This struggle IS the training.

Step by step walk the thousand-mile road. Stop adding new languages until one is truly yours.
